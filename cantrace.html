At the time, the isolation and quarantine measures in place were in the hope of reducing occurrences of novel cases and flattening the curve, however we needed something to expedite and aid the process.</p>
                            <h2 class="bot-space-s">Solution</h2>
                            <p class="grey about bot-space-m">Contact tracing is an integral practice that the healthcare system employs to ensure isolation of at-risk contacts however the practice is done manually; so we created an app that automated the process.

                    <p class="grey about bot-space-m">Contact tracing is a process involving a public health agent identifying, assessing, and monitoring individuals infected by a communicable disease, in order to mitigate transmission. While contact-tracing is an effective tool, it is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and subject to recall error. These shortcomings became strikingly evident due to COVID-19’s marked infectivity, particularly in densely populated environments, straining public health resources. As a result, our goal was to work on a digital contact tracing solution that involved using a smartphone app to track the proximity between people, which addressed the limitations of physical contact tracing due to the significant speed and scalability potential. We wanted to create a product for Canada as contact tracing apps natively help expedite and centralize the entire process to make the process simpler.</p>
                    <h2 class="bot-space-s">Secondary market research</h2>
                    <p class="grey about bot-space-m">In order to understand our target market, identify new opportunities and set realistic targets based on concrete data, we conducted market research in two key areas. We looked into the rate of downloads of contact tracing apps in many countries to set realistic targets and investigate why they are so high/low. In addition, we researched Canadian government survey data to understand our target market and who exactly we were building our product for.</p>

                    <h2 class="bot-space-s">Takeaways</h2>
                    <p class="grey about bot-space-s">1.) Age is an important factor in the likelihood of using such an app as older Canadians are more likely to use the app than young Canadians</p>
                    <p class="grey about bot-space-s">2.) Concerns about privacy and government access to location data are the leading reasons against using a contact tracing app</p>
                    <p class="grey about bot-space-s">3.) Secondary reasons are poor healthcare integration and guidance in-app</p>
                    <p class="grey about bot-space-m">4.) The above factors seemed to be leading factors in downloading contact tracing apps in other countries as well</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="bot-space-s">Figuring out the right technology</h2>
                    <p class="grey about bot-space-m">Keeping the user in mind, we investigated several different technologies to conduct tracing safely and reliably as that was a key factor for users. Various technical modalities exist to determine proximity traces, including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Global Positioning System (GPS), WiFi and Quick Response (QR) codes, among others. However, GPS and BLE dominated global discussions and were the most commonly used methods. GPS configures proximity by using timing and location measurements to identify overlap between app users’ paths. It poses the benefits of providing location context of exposures, and critical geolocation data to public health to identify infection hotspots and analyze disease spread. However, GPS is unable to resolve between objects within 4.9 meters of each other, and signal accuracy is undermined near physical barriers (like tall buildings).</p>
                    <p class="grey about bot-space-m">BLE possesses key advantages over GPS including its ability to detect short distances between individuals and better discern proximity between those confined to the same geographical coordinates yet separated by elevation like in multi-storey buildings. Additionally, it is operational underground such as in tunnels or subways where satellite signalling is obstructed. Importantly, BLE’s capacity to configure proximity traces without processing or storing sensitive location data draws fewer privacy concerns. Based on these factors, we focused on building our product around BLE.</p>
                    <img class="cs-img white bot-space-m" src="/assets/cs-cantrace/table1.png" alt="Table comparing Bluetooth and GPS">
        
                    <h2 class="bot-space-s">The Apple/Google API</h2>
                    <p class="grey about bot-space-m">Contact tracing apps using BLE were initially hampered by a limitation on devices using Apple’s iOS operating system which required phones to be perpetually “awake”, and apps open in the foreground to keep BLE readings active. Furthermore, BLE communications were stifled from signalling inter-compatibility issues between Android and iOS devices. Consequently, app adoption rates were significantly reduced, which further minimized their contact tracing potential. As a result, Google and Apple partnered to create an Application Program Interface (API), a program that mediated interactions between different software, which effectively resolved these limitations. The API was also lauded for preserving user privacy by operating within the decentralized framework and barring the co-existence of GPS technology on contact tracing apps adoptings it. Due to its technical and privacy advantages, it became the standard operating software for contact tracing apps like ours.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="bot-space-s">Further researching other apps</h2>
                    <p class="grey about bot-space-m">After figuring out what technology and how effective certain methods can be, we collected data from a few different contact tracing apps and investigated what may be the reason behind low adoption rates, technologies they used and how much they kept the user's privacy in mind. After conducting this research, it only supported our prior research and we knew we were on the right track to solve the user's biggest problems against such an app.</p>

                    <p class="grey about bot-space-m">Taking what we learned from our research, storyboarding and our problems in mind, it was important to understand the types of users who were going to be using the product. Going back to these personas throughout the process kept us aligned with our user goals, empathize and helped us solve the problems more efficiently. In addition to our research, knowing that this virus does not discriminate and has no barriers, we knew the most important people we were creating this for were the elderly. And on the other side of the spectrum, we had someone younger. What this also helped us understand better is how simple and easy-to-use we must create our product.</p>

Already released contact tracing apps fell short, they only focused primarily on notifying users if they had an exposure risk and nothing more.</p>

                    <p class="grey about bot-space-m">Our design recommendations operated within the API framework, capitalizing on its privacy and technical advantages, while incorporating user-centric features and healthcare elements to integrate conventional contact tracing efforts. Broadly, these recommendations augmented the API exposure notification platform with evidence-based characteristics to optimize both privacy and efficacy, help maximize app adoption rates, and minimize disease transmission. Without healthcare integration, apps did little to support contact tracing efforts by public health. Our solution was bridges the gap between technology and healthcare to create an effective tool to fight against infection, expedite recovery, and preserve civil liberties for the common good of all Canadians.</p>

                    <p class="grey about bot-space-m">When you're building a product that can potentially be used by 36 million people, the way your mind thinks changes a little. You get that extra motivation to complete the product with pristine perfection and work with your colleagues in going through the entire design process thoroughly and effectively. The most challenging aspect of the whole experience was to earn the trust of the user. Privacy and security were the biggest reasons people had against using such an app. So as a product designer, it was key to empathize with the user and understand that you need to design an experience that is simple to use and earns the trust of the users directly. All while keeping in mind that this app would be used by people of all ages. The way I solved this was looking at other apps that have a large age demographic and have a privacy aspect to it. In addition, I frequently communicated with our lawyer and privacy experts about the design and content to perfect the design.</p>
                    <p class="grey about bot-space-m">By the time we presented our product to the government, they had already started developing their own app with Shopify and Blackberry and so we did not have much of a chance. But in retrospect, some features of our app were added into the COVID Alert app officially released by the federal government. The biggest learning I would take from this whole experience is to think swiftly, you never know when the opportunity may close.</p>
