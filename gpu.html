          <h1>Sourcing of Raw Materials</h1>
          <hr size="16px" />
          <p>
            The production of an Nvidia GPU requires several raw materials, such
            as silicon, copper, aluminum, and rare earth minerals like tantalum,
            tungsten, and cobalt. These materials are sourced from different
            parts of the world, often from countries with abundant mineral
            reserves, such as China, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and
            Australia. However, the extraction of these minerals can have
            significant social and environmental consequences, including human
            rights abuses, child labor, and environmental degradation.
          </p>
          <hr size="16px" />
          <p>
            The mining industry in some regions has been associated with
            conflicts, corruption, and exploitation. The conditions under which
            these minerals are extracted can be hazardous for workers, and there
            have been concerns about child labor in the mining of minerals like
            cobalt. These social and economic challenges highlight the need for
            responsible sourcing and ethical supply chains in the technology

          <h1>Manufacturing</h1>
          <hr size="16px" />
          <p>
            Once the raw materials are sourced, they are processed and
            manufactured into GPU components. The manufacturing of Nvidia GPUs
            predominantly takes place in East Asia, particularly in countries
            like Taiwan, China, and South Korea, where there is an established
            electronics manufacturing industry.
          </p>
          <hr size="16px" />
          <p>
            The manufacturing process involves intricate assembly lines and
            advanced technologies. The working conditions in manufacturing
            facilities can vary, ranging from well-regulated and safe
            environments to those with poor labor conditions, low wages, and
            long working hours. Labor rights and occupational safety are
            important considerations at this stage. Protests and labor movements
            have emerged in various regions, demanding fair treatment, improved
            working conditions, and workers' rights in the technology
            manufacturing sector.
          </p>
          <hr size="16px" />
          <p>
            Nvidia's strategic decision to outsource parts of GPU production to
            TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) has allowed them
            to leverage TSMC's advanced manufacturing capabilities and
            expertise. However, this outsourcing raises concerns regarding the
            lack of direct control over the working conditions at TSMC
            facilities. If TSMC were to have poor worker conditions, it would
            pose a challenge for Nvidia to ensure ethical practices throughout
            their supply chain. Upholding responsible sourcing and labor
            standards becomes even more crucial in such scenarios, highlighting
            the importance of transparency and collaboration to address these
            potential issues.

          <hr size="16px" />
          <p>
            Once the Nvidia GPUs are manufactured, they are distributed globally
            to various markets. Distribution involves logistics networks,
            shipping, and transportation. GPUs are primarily sold to original
            equipment manufacturers (OEMs) who incorporate them into their
            computer systems or sell them directly to consumers.
          </p>
          <hr size="16px" />
          <p>
            The consumption of Nvidia GPUs is widespread, with customers ranging
            from individual consumers to large organizations. The demand for
            high-performance GPUs is driven by industries such as gaming,
            artificial intelligence, data centers, and scientific research. The
            availability and pricing of GPUs can be influenced by factors like
            market demand, tariffs, import/export regulations, and economic
            conditions.

          <h1>Recycling or Disposal</h1>
          <hr size="16px" />
          <p>
            At the end of their lifecycle, Nvidia GPUs can be recycled or
            disposed of. Recycling electronic waste is crucial to mitigate
            environmental impact and recover valuable materials. Many countries
            have implemented regulations for the proper disposal and recycling
            of electronic waste.
          </p>
          <hr size="16px" />
          <p>
            Recycling processes involve extracting valuable metals and
            components from GPUs while safely managing hazardous substances.
            However, improper recycling practices, such as e-waste dumping in
            developing countries, can lead to environmental pollution and health
            risks. Responsible e-waste management and recycling are essential to
            minimize the environmental and social consequences of electronic
            waste disposal.

          <hr size="16px" />
          <p>
            Throughout the stages of the global journey, there have been social
            protests related to the production and consumption of technology
            devices, including GPUs. Protests have focused on labor rights,
            worker conditions, environmental concerns, and responsible sourcing.
          </p>
          <hr size="16px" />
          <p>
            Regarding the carbon footprint, the production and consumption of
            Nvidia GPUs contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Manufacturing
            processes, transportation, and energy consumption all contribute to
            the carbon footprint of these devices. Nvidia has made efforts to
            reduce its environmental impact, including investing in
            energy-efficient technologies and initiatives to optimize power

            Congratulations on completing the guessing game! We hope you've
            gained valuable insights into the global journey of Nvidia GPUs and
            their environmental impact. Throughout the game, you discovered the
            intricate components that make up a graphics card, from the printed
            circuit board to the GPU's heat sink, and shroud. You learned about
            the environmental challenges associated with the acquisition of raw
            materials, including rare earth metals, and the manufacturing
            processes involved. By understanding the environmental consequences
            of GPU production, we can strive for a more sustainable future.
            Remember, every small step towards responsible consumption and
            disposal of electronic devices contributes to preserving our
            planet's well-being. Keep up the eco-conscious mindset and continue
            to explore the intersections of technology, society, and the
            environment.

      <h3>
        Exploring the global journey of Nvidia GPUs has provided us with a
        deeper understanding of the intricate processes and environmental
        challenges associated with their production, consumption, and disposal.
        From the acquisition of raw materials to the manufacturing of complex
        components, we have witnessed the social and environmental consequences
        embedded within the technology industry. However, we have also uncovered
        the collective efforts being made to address these challenges, such as
        responsible sourcing, ethical supply chains, and the implementation of
        sustainable practices. By recognizing the broader implications of
        information technology and globalization, we are empowered to advocate
        for a more sustainable and equitable future. Let us strive for
        technological advancements that prioritize environmental stewardship,
        social responsibility, and the well-being of our planet. Together, we
        can shape a world where innovation coexists harmoniously with
        sustainability.
